        <h3>A Peerless Advocate for Children</h3>
        <h2>Early Career</h2>
        <p>Since 1977, Judy Brownell has been an advocate for children in the state of Georgia. Starting with the Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS), she found her passion in being a child advocate early in her career. After many years at DFACS, she transitioned to the District Attorney’s office, where she worked in child advocacy and legal protection, innovating several programs still in use to this day. One of her main achievements at the DA’s office was being an instrumental part of preparing children and minors to face those who wronged them in a courtroom setting — a task that required her to arm her charges with positive tools and psychological defenses that would come to serve many of them later in life.</p>
        <h2>Private Sector</h2>
        <p>After her career in government, she then transitioned to the private sector, still working in child advocacy and life-literacy, often serving marginalized communities and groups of varying socioeconomic strata, but with a focus on teens in under-privileged situations. Her career led her eventually to work at a local high school for many years, where her passion for helping children blossomed into a focus on tobacco and drug literacy, developing state-wide initiatives geared towards helping teens make positive decisions about abstaining from drug and alcohol use.</p>
        <h2>Continuing the Mission</h2>
        <p>In her current role, she travels the state giving lectures and presentations using scientific data coupled with testimonials and life stories of those whose lives have been either negatively or positively affected by drugs and alcohol, as well as other psychological afflictions (depression and self-harm). Still vivacious in her seventies, her wit, humor, compassion and intelligence entertain and inspire so many kids in wildly varying communities — all while educating them on how to build a foundation of self-empowering decisions, critical thinking, and both shared and lived wisdom. A truly remarkable woman who is tough as nails and yet yielding as a flower, I am proud to say that Judy Brownell, my mother, is a true Steel Magnolia.</p>
