        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Thomasville, Georgia, Judy attended the local high school and excelled in pretty much everything, to hear her sister tell it. Always a deeply compassionate person, her true nature blossomed when she attended Agnes Scott College, where her passion for helping others took center stage in her choice of vocation.</p>

        <p>It was at DFACS that she met my father, and the two were wed shortly thereafter. After a few years, her son (me) came into the picture, and in many ways helped to cement her focus on being a lifelong child advocate. As a mother, she was — and still is — peerless, and as a force of nature protecting children, she is unmatched. Her fierce intelligence and drive have given birth to state-wide initiatives in the state of Georgia, and many government programs still bear the marks and impressions that Judy left on them.</p>

        <p>She has met and befriended business leaders, members of government from both parties on the local, state, and national levels, philanthropists, and donors of all stripes. The best way to describe her is: she's a woman with a mission, and her mission — the well-being of children everywhere — always comes first.</p>
